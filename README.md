# Legal Desk Student Data-Scientist
This is a small task applicants will be asked to perform as part of the screening process. 

This is a task that simulates what a clasical task could be for a student data-scientist/analyst when working at Legal Desk. We have created some synthetic sample data which could mimic how our interal data-structures look.
